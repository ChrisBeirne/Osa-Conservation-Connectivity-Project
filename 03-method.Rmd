We have a suite of different tools available for connectivity modelling. The following section is an actively updated workbook which trials these methods, summarizes them, and decides on the approach. In Chapters 4-6, we implement the models. 

## Connectivity

There are two general approached to performing connectivity mapping. Firstly, a least-cost-path approach where we can use graph theory to solve the easiest path from point A to point B. This is a deterministic approach where you get the same result each time and one route with no error. The second approach uses electrical theory to apply a charge across and landscape and measure the resulting current. This is a probabilistic approach. Both approached require the input of a "cost surface" or "conductance surface" - a raster detailing the ease of movement. For more details, see below:

```
In a nutshell, Grainscape takes a landscape resistance surface, creates grains of connectivity and minimum planar graph models that can be used to calculate effective distances for landscape connectivity at multiple scales. We can also identify nodes through which we would like animals to move (e.g. starting point -> reefs; end points -> ridges).

Example:

Below shows a network of patches (cream colour) and resistances (other colours):

```{r ch3_2, include=F}
patchy <- raster(system.file("extdata/patchy.asc", package = "grainscape"))

isBecomes <- cbind(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(1, 10, 8, 3, 6))
patchyCost <- reclassify(patchy, rcl = isBecomes)

## Plot this raster using ggplot2 functionality
## and the default grainscape theme 
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ggGS(patchyCost),
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Paired", guide = "legend") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Resistance")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

We then take this network of patches and calculate the 'MPG'- the Minimum Planer Graph =  an efficient approximation of all possible pairwise connections between nodes. We currently assume that the costs are all 1 between patches, but this can be altered to incorporate a resistance surface. 

```{r ch3_3, include=F}
patchyMPG <- MPG(patchyCost, patch = (patchyCost == 1))
```

And then we can then visualize these associations:

```{r ch3_4}
plot(patchyMPG, quick = "mpgPlot", theme = FALSE)
```

We can then impose a threshold to define which patches are "linked" strongly and which are not. First we must define how many "units" a given organism can move over, for example here we could use 250. The green lines denote "connected" patches for this organism, the black unconnected. 

```{r ch3_5, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
scalarAnalysis <- threshold(patchyMPG, nThresh = 5)

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ggGS(patchyMPG, "patchId"),
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value > 0)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "grey") +
  geom_segment(data  = ggGS(patchyMPG, "links"),
               aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2,
                   colour = lcpPerimWeight >= 250, size=1.2)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("forestgreen", NA)) +
  geom_point(data = ggGS(patchyMPG, "nodes"), aes(x = x, y = y),
             colour = "darkgreen")
```

The graph above shows that this species would see the landscape as 6 discrete units. Whilst this is superficially useful, it is not really what we are trying to achieve in this project. 

#### Distance between nodes

The reason why Grainscape was create was to create the following graph. It represents a model which:

- is aware of a spatially-explicit landscape
- incorporates the shape, size and configuration of two-dimensional node patches (e.g. protected areas)
- can handle continuous geographic variation (resistance) in the spaces between the nodes (i.e., the matrix)

In a minimum planar graph (MPG) the matrix presents resistance to connectivity and influences the paths and therefore the lengths of the links. The shape, size and configuration of patches with respect to their neighbors that influences where on the patch perimeters these links begin and end. The value of using patch perimeters rather than centroids is that it potentially improves the estimation of the shortest paths among patches.


```{r ch3_6, echo=F}
## Load a land cover raster distributed with grainscape
frag <- raster(system.file("extdata/fragmented.asc", package = "grainscape"))

## Convert land cover to resistance units
## Use an "is-becomes" reclassification
isBecomes <- cbind(c(1, 2,  3,   4), c(1, 5, 10, 12))

fragRes <- reclassify(frag, rcl = isBecomes)


f1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ggGS(fragRes),
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value))+ coord_fixed()


## Extract a network using cells = 1 on original raster
## as the focal patches or nodes
patches <- (frag == 1)
fragMPG <- MPG(fragRes, patch = patches)


## Plot the minimum planar graph with node labels for several
## focal nodes of interest
f2 <- plot(fragMPG, quick = "mpgPlot", theme = FALSE) +
  geom_text(data = ggGS(fragMPG, "nodes"),
            aes(x = x, y = y,
                label = ifelse(patchId %in% c(7, 23, 52, 106, 158, 221),
                               patchId, "")),
            size = 2) +
  ggtitle("Planar 2D; Resistance surface")

ggarrange(f1,f2)


```

There are many other options for types of analysis, but one of the things we can do is finding the shortest route between two patches.

```{r ch3_7, include =F}

fragNeighbours <- graphdf(fragMPG)[[1]]$e[ , c(1, 2, 4)]
fragNeighbours <- fragNeighbours[order(fragNeighbours[,1]), ]
names(fragNeighbours) <- c("Node 1", "Node 2", "Path distance (Resistance)")
#kbl(fragNeighbours, row.names = FALSE)
```

Finding the shortest path through the network from a source to a destination node and the length of that path is a useful prediction of the network model and has many applications. It gives an expected distance through the network, taking into account the modeled connectivity among nodes.

```{r ch3_8, echo=F}
# You define the start and end patches using patch ID's

## Declare the start and end patchIds
## These were identified by plotting the patchIds (see earlier examples)
startEnd <- c(1546, 94)

## Find the shortest path between these nodes using 
## the shortest path through the resistance surface 
## (i.e. weighted by 'lcpPerimWeight')
shPath <- shortest_paths(fragMPG$mpg,
                         from = which(V(fragMPG$mpg)$patchId == startEnd[1]),
                         to = which(V(fragMPG$mpg)$patchId == startEnd[2]),
                         weights = E(fragMPG$mpg)$lcpPerimWeight,
                         output = "both")

## Extract the nodes and links of this shortest path
shPathN <- as.integer(names(shPath$vpath[[1]]))
shPathL <- E(fragMPG$mpg)[shPath$epath[[1]]]$linkId

## Produce shortest path tables for plotting
shPathNodes <- subset(ggGS(fragMPG, "nodes"), patchId %in% shPathN)
shPathLinks <- subset(ggGS(fragMPG, "links"), linkId %in% shPathL)

## Find the distance of the shortest path
shPathD <- distances(fragMPG$mpg,
                     v = which(V(fragMPG$mpg)$patchId == startEnd[1]),
                     to = which(V(fragMPG$mpg)$patchId == startEnd[2]),
                     weights = E(fragMPG$mpg)$lcpPerimWeight)[1]

## Plot shortest path
figure20 <- ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ggGS(fragMPG, "patchId"),
              aes(x = x, y = y,
                  fill = ifelse(value %in% shPathN, "grey70", "grey90"))) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  geom_segment(data  = shPathLinks, aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2),

#### How we could use this framework

We could use this framework to evaluate the least cost path between protected reef/coastline areas, up to the 'nearest' elevation park by distance. This would, initially at least, give use a candidate set of locations with which we can use "high" resolution models to evaluate at the local scale (see the Circuitscape section). 

#### Costa Rica example

To demonstrate the type of information we can get from a least cost paths approach we will use Costa Rica as a case study. First we input the data:

```{r ch3_9, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# To start this I need a target raster of the appropriate resolution
# We can use the GHM rastor as the template
ghm_raster <- read_stars("data/spatial/human_modification_index/gHM_2016.tif")

ghm_raster_17N <- st_warp(ghm_raster, crs=31971)
#plot(ghm_raster, las=1,nbreaks=11 ,breaks="equal", col=terrain.colors(10), bg="grey")
#plot(ghm_raster_17N, las=1,nbreaks=11 ,breaks="equal", col=terrain.colors(10), bg="grey")

focal_pa <- readRDS( "data/spatial/WDPA_protected_areas/focal_area_pa_shp.RDS")

focal_pa <- st_transform(focal_pa,st_crs(4326)) 
focal_pa <- focal_pa %>% st_sf() %>%  st_cast()

focal_pa_17N <- st_transform(focal_pa, crs=31971)

roi_17N <- st_transform(merged_shp, crs=31971)
#plot(st_geometry(merged_shp), col=rgb(0,0,0,0.1), border=F)
#plot(st_geometry(focal_pa[focal_pa$DESIG_TYPE=="International",]), col=met.brewer("Nizami")[1], add=T)
#plot(st_geometry(focal_pa[focal_pa$DESIG_TYPE=="National",]), col=met.brewer("Nizami")[6], add=T)
#legend("topright", c("National protected areas"), pch=15, col=c(met.brewer("Nizami")[6]))
  
# Convert these to a raster

# First the focal area - assign these the values of 2
roi_ras <- st_rasterize(roi_17N,template=ghm_raster_17N, align=T) # default 


```

Our area of interest is:

```{r ch3_10, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
plot(roi_ras, axes = TRUE)
# Convert the landmass to 2
roi_ras[[1]][roi_ras[[1]]==0 & is.na(roi_ras[[1]])==F] <- 2
# All land mass has value <- 2

```

We then import the protected areas and give them a lower resistance (1) the surrounding areas (2):

```{r ch3_11, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# rasterize based on geometry and a column named "value". Change the name of this column if necessary
pa_ras <- st_rasterize(focal_pa_17N[focal_pa_17N$DESIG_TYPE=="National","geometry"],template=ghm_raster_17N, align=T ) # default 
# Convert the protected area to 1
pa_ras[[1]][pa_ras[[1]]>1 & is.na(pa_ras[[1]])==F] <- 1
# Make non prtected ares 0 
pa_ras[[1]][is.na(pa_ras[[1]])==T] <- 0


#plot(roi_ras, axes=T, main="Focal area")
#plot(pa_ras, axes=T, main = "Protected areas")

crop_area <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(roi_ras))

#st_bbox(roi_ras)
#st_bbox(ghm_raster_17N)
#st_bbox(pa_ras)

cost_ras <- st_crop(roi_ras, crop_area) - st_crop(pa_ras, crop_area)

#par(mfrow=c(1,3))
#plot(roi_ras, axes=T, main="Focal area")
#plot(pa_ras, axes=T, main = "Protected areas")
plot(cost_ras, axes=T, main="Non-protected areas")
#plot(ghm_raster_17N)

# Convert to raster
cost_ras <-  as(cost_ras, "Raster")
cost_ghm <-  as(ghm_raster_17N, "Raster")

# Make it discrete
cost_ghm <- round(cost_ghm*10,0)+1
# Invert it
cost_ghm <- (cost_ghm*-1)
cost_ghm <- (cost_ghm+12)

#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#plot(cost_ghm)

# Visualise on leaflet
# library(leafem)
# leaflet() %>%
#   addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>%
#   addRasterImage(cost_ghm)
# This is a basic cost surface, In reality, people use much stronger cost surfaces. eg. running from 0-1000, and excluding areas completely which are overdeveloped. 


# Make the 1's NA's
#summary(cost_ghm)
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==1] <- NA
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==2] <- 2
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==3] <- 5
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==4] <- 10
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==5] <- 50
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==6] <- 100
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==7] <- 150
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==8] <- 200
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==9] <- 600
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==10] <- 800
cost_ghm[cost_ghm==11] <- 1000


```

We can then add in the human modification index, and adjust the conductance scores according to the levels of human modification (1000 = high conductance, 1 = low conductance). 

```{r ch3_12, echo=F}
plot(cost_ghm)

high_pa_17N <- st_transform(high_pa, 31971)

```


We can then use this to calculate the least cost path. We subsequently discovered that there are variety of packages to perform this calculation. 

All packages lean on 'gdistance' to implement least cost paths. A second package, which focuses on human movement, 'leastcostpath' also provides some useful functions. 

We can then pick two locations, one as a source node, the other as a destination. Lets compare two different cost surfaces, one which just has protected none protected (left) and one which incorporates HMI:

```{r ch3_13, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, eval=F}

#See https://rdrr.io/cran/gdistance/f/vignettes/Overview.Rmd

# Convert the protected areas into 17N

# https://bookdown.org/hhwagner1/LandGenCourse_book/WE_10.html

# You must take your resistance raster and create a transition layer
# NOTE gdistance creates "CONDUCTANCE" the higher the value the easier the movement

# Protected not protected
tr.cost1 <- gdistance::transition(1/cost_ras, transitionFunction=mean, directions=8) 

#Note one you have your transitions layers you can add and subtract them etc. Nifty. 

# HMI
tr.cost2 <- gdistance::transition(cost_ghm, transitionFunction=mean, directions=8) 

# Write these objects
saveRDS(tr.cost1, "data/Chapter3/Transition_raster1.RDS")

saveRDS(tr.cost2, "data/Chapter3/Transition_raster2.RDS")


```

```{r, echo=F}
tr.cost1 <- readRDS( "data/Chapter3/Transition_raster1.RDS")
tr.cost2 <- readRDS( "data/Chapter3/Transition_raster2.RDS")
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#plot(raster::raster(tr.cost1))
#plot(raster::raster(tr.cost2))

```



```{r ch3_14, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, include=F}

# Import the mangroves
mangrove_17N <- st_transform(mangrove_large,31971)
A <- as_Spatial(st_centroid(mangrove_17N[4,]))
B <- as_Spatial(st_centroid(high_pa_17N[30,]))

par(mfrow=c(1,1))

plot(st_geometry(st_centroid(mangrove_17N[4,])), pch=19, col="red", xlim=c(40000,36000))

plot(st_geometry(roi_17N), col="grey")
plot(st_geometry(focal_pa_17N), col="green", add=T, border=F)

plot(st_geometry(st_centroid(mangrove_17N[4,])), add=T, pch=19, col="red")
plot(st_geometry(st_centroid(st_centroid(high_pa_17N[30,]))), add=T, pch=19, col="blue")

```

Setup a start and end point thenn run the calculations and plot the resulting paths:

```{r ch3_15, echo =F}
#tmp <- create_lcp(cost_surface = tr.cost1, origin=A, destination=B, direction=F)
#plot(tmp[1,], add = T, col = "red")
#plot(tmp[2,], add = T, col = "blue")


########################## 
# Also try with gDistance

#costDistance(tr.cost1, fromCoords=A, 
#                                toCoords=B)
# Takes too long
#rSPDistance(tr.cost1, from=A, 
#                      to=B, 
#            theta=1e-12, totalNet="total")
  # Or with g distance
lc_1 <- gdistance::shortestPath(tr.cost1, origin=A, 
                                goal=B, output="SpatialLines")

lc_2 <- gdistance::shortestPath(tr.cost2, origin=A, 
                                goal=B, output="SpatialLines")

tmp1 <- st_as_sf(lc_1)

tmp2 <- st_as_sf(lc_2)

# Condusctance units
#cond_1 <- raster::extract(raster(tr.cost1), tmp1)
#cond_2 <- raster::extract(raster(tr.cost2), tmp2)

#sum(cond_1[[1]], na.rm=T)
#sum(cond_2[[1]], na.rm=T)



#costDistance(tr.cost1, fromCoords = A, 
#                                toCoords =B)

#costDistance(tr.cost2, fromCoords = A, 
#                                toCoords =B)


# You can also plot accumulated cost
# plot(accCost(tr.cost1, fromCoords=A))
# plot(accCost(tr.cost2, fromCoords=A))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
par(mar=c(4,5,1,3))
plot(raster(tr.cost1))
plot(lc_1, col = "blue", add=T) # HAVENT EXCLUDED WATER

plot(raster(tr.cost2))
plot(lc_2, col = "red", add=T)

# Extract info on the lines

```

As you can see the second example makes more "sense" from an animals perspective. We can also calculate the distance the line takes, for example for the protected/non-protected example it is `r round(as.numeric(st_length(tmp1))/1000,1)` km, and for the human modification index example it is `r round(as.numeric(st_length(tmp2))/1000,1)` km. 

We can now design a loop to run from source locations of interest, to end nodes of interest (see Chapter 5).

## Probalistic approach

One of the principal concerns with least cost paths is that they do not consider alternative routes to the one determined. To get around this we will use the 'Circuitscape' framework to create high resolution probabilistic maps. Circuitscape has rapidly become the most widely used connectivity analysis package in the world. It is used by numerous state, federal, and local agencies worldwide. The data output can be used for spatially explicit conservation planning. 

Circuitscape uses circuit theory to predict movements of animals and how these affect overall population connectivity. It equates the flow of animal movement across a heterogeneous landscapes to the flow of electrical current through a circuit. Using a "resistance surface" which reflects a map of habitats available to animals - neighboring grid cells are connected by resistors,
 whose level of resistance represents the friction of the landscape to animal movement (i.e., low
resistance grid cells are most likely to be traversed, high resistance cells less likely). Circuitscape solves the optimum routes through these resistance surfaces in a probabilistic fashion.  

The output below shows the application of 'circuitscape' to model the connectivity of protected areas for tigers in an Indian province:

A Sampling of Circuitscape Applications from Around the World
Wildlife corridor design

Within the Nature Conservancy, connectivity analyses using Circuitscape are being used in planning exercises affecting tens of millions of dollars for land acquisition, restoration, and management. Other NGOs, whether small ones like the Snow Leopard Conservancy or large ones like the Wildlife Conservation Society, are using Circuitscape to set conservation priorities. Here are some recent examples of research in this area.

Multispecies connectivity planning in Borneo (Brodie et al. 2015).Connectivity for pumas in Arizona and New Mexico (Dickson et al. 2013).Large landscape planning across Ontario, Canada (Bowman and Cordes 2015).Connectivity prioritization for gibbons (Vasudev and Fletcher 2015).Corridors for tigers in India (Joshi et al. 2013, Dutta et al. 2015).Connectivity for Amur leopards in China (Jiang et al. 2015).Trans-boundary conservation of Persian leopards in Iran, Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan (Farhadiniaa et al. 2015).Multi-scale connectivity planning in Australia (Lechner et al. 2015).Wall-to-wall’ methods that don’t require core areas to connect (Anderson et al. 2012, 2014, Pelletier et al. 2014).

Dutta et al. (2015) combined Circuitscape with least-cost corridor methods to map pinch points within corridors connecting protected areas for tigers in central India. Areas with high current flow are most important for tiger movements and keeping the network connected.
Landscape genetics

Landscape genetics is the study of how landscape pattern (the distribution of suitable habitat, barriers, etc.) affects gene flow and genetic differentiation among plant and animal populations. Circuitscape is widely used in this field, and has been combined with genetic data to show

    the resilience of montane rainforest lizards to past climate change in the Australian tropics (Bell et al. 2010);

    how oil palm plantations isolate squirrel monkeys in Costa Rica, and where corridors of native trees could reconnect populations (Blair et al. 2012);

    how the pattern of climatically stable habitat structures genetics of canyon live oaks (Ortego et al. 2014);

    how genetics and connectivity models can be combined to design Indian tiger corridors (Yumnam et al. 2014);

    how urban trees facilitate animal gene flow (Munshi-South 2012);

    how climate change and montane refugia have structured salamander populations in southern California (Devitt et al. 2013);

    the effects of landscape change on movement among prairie dog colonies (Sackett et al. 2012); and

    how landscape features influence genetic connectivity for dozens of species, from songbirds in British Columbia (Adams et al. 2016) to army ants in Panama (Pérez-Espona et al. 2012).

Movement ecology

Circuit theory can also be used to predict movements of animals and how these affect overall population connectivity. As with landscape genetics, this application is tightly tied to conservation planning. Examples include

    movements of African wild dogs and cheetahs in South Africa (Jackson et al. 2016);

    wolverine dispersal in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (McClure et al. 2016);

    how periodic flooding affects connectivity for amphibians in Australia (Bishop-Taylor et al. 2015);

    predicting where mitigating road impacts on connectivity would reduce wildlife mortality in France (Girardet et al. 2015) and Canada (Koen et al. 2014);

    movement and gap crossing behavior of forest interior songbirds (St. Louis et al. 2014); and

    how local abundance and dispersal scale up to affect metapopulation persistence and community stability (Brodie et al. 2016).

Circuit theory is being used to mitigate road impacts on wildlife and improve driver safety in at least six countries. (a) Circuit theory (implemented using Graphab) outperformed other connectivity models for predicting vehicle collisions with roe deer in France (Girardet et al. 2015). (b) A wall-to-wall connectivity map created using Circuitscape was highly correlated with road mortality for amphibians and reptiles and habitat use by fishers in eastern Ontario, Canada (from Koen et al. 2014). Similar methods are now being used across Ontario and in many other parts of Canada.
Connectivity for climate change

Predicting important areas for range shifts under climate change is an exciting new application of Circuitscape. One of the most important ways species have responded to past climatic changes has been to shift their ranges to track suitable climates. Rapid warming projected for the next century means many species and populations will need to move even faster than in the past or face extinction. Many species are already moving in response to rapid warming, but they are encountering barriers—like roads, agricultural areas, and cities—that weren’t present in the past. In order for species to maintain population connectivity and the ability to adapt to climate change, we need to identify and conserve important movement routes. Here are some ways Circuitscape can be used to address this need:

    Hodgson et al. (2012) showed how circuit theory can be used to design landscapes that promote rapid range shifts.

    Lawler et al. (2013) used Circuitscape to project movements of nearly 3000 species in response to climate change across the Western Hemisphere. See an animation of their results here.

    Razgour (2015) combined species distributions, climate projections, genetic data, and Circuitscape to predict range shift pathways for bats in Iberia.

    New methods connecting natural lands to those that have similar projected future climates (Littlefield et al. in review) and connecting across climate gradients (McRae et al. in 2016) are in active development.

Projected climate-driven range shifts of 2903 species in response to climate change using Circuitscape. Arrows represent the direction of modelled movements from unsuitable climates to suitable climates via routes that avoid human land uses. From Lawler et al. (2013).

New applications: infectious disease, fire, and agriculture

Circuitscape is breaking into new areas like epidemiology, invasive species spread, archaeology, and fire management. Examples include

    how road networks drive HIV spread in Africa (Tatem et al. 2012);

    spread of invasive insects, including disease-carrying mosquitos (Cowley et al. 2015, Andraca- Gómez et al. 2015, Medley et al. 2014);

    understanding why species reintroductions succeed or fail (Ziółkowska et al. 2016);

    spread of a disease that is threatening rice production in Africa (Trovão et al. 2015);

    spread of rabies (Barton et al. 2010, Rioux Paquette et al. 2014);

    how climate and habitat fragmentation drive Lyme disease at its range limit (Simon et al. 2014).

    fuel connectivity and wildfire risk (Gray and Dickson 2015, 2016); and

    strategic fuel breaks to protect sage-grouse habitat from wildfire (Welch et al. 2015).

Fire likelihood across Arizona’s lower Sonoran Desert, using Circuitscape to model fuel connectivity. Areas with high predicted fire risk corresponded with burned area data showing where wildfires occurred from 2000 to 2012 (Gray and Dickson 2015). This method has been extended to evaluate fuel treatments where invasive cheatgrass is increasing fire (Gray and Dickson 2016).

Welch et al. (2015) used a similar analysis to identify strategic areas for fuel breaks to protect greater sage-grouse habitat.
How Circuitscape Complements other Models

Circuitscape isn’t the right modeling method for every connectivity application, but it is strongly complementary to others, and often works well in conjunction with other methods. For example, McClure et al. (2016) compared least-cost paths and Circuitscape for predicting elk and wolverine movements using GPS-collared animals. They found that Circuitscape outperformed least-cost paths for predicting wolverine dispersal, but slightly underperformed them for elk. This makes sense, because circuit models reflect random exploration of the landscape, and dispersing juvenile wolverines are making exploratory movements since they do not have perfect knowledge. Elk, on the other hand, are following routes established over generations, and have much better knowledge of the best pathways.
Hybrid approaches

New hybrid methods are taking advantage of both circuit and least-cost methods. In their tiger study, Dutta et al. (2015) combined least-cost corridors and Circuitscape to map the most important and vulnerable connectivity areas connecting tiger reserves. And in their work on invasive mosquitoes, Medley et al. (2014) found that circuit and least-cost-based analyses complemented each other, with differing strengths at different movement scales and in different contexts. Using the two models in concert gave the most insight into mosquito movement and spread. Other papers that combine methods, taking advantage of different strengths for different processes and scales, include Rayfield et al. (2015), Lechner et al. (2015), Fagan et al. (2016), and Ziółkowska et al. (2016).
