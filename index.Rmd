## Executive Summary

Mountain ranges constitute biodiversity hotspots and their importance only grows as lowland species shift their ranges in elevation in response to climate change. Protecting gradients which connect low to high elevation habitats are thus essential to preserving future biodiversity. However, most of the world’s mountain ranges are narrowly protected and lack the elevational distributions needed to preserve biodiversity. We map the connectivity and protected status of elevational gradients from oceans to mountain ranges in mainland central america to reveal where connectivity between protected areas and important habitats is needed and may be optimized. To our knowledge this is the first synthesis of its type for this region.

We also find clear differences in the degree to which lowland protected areas are connected to high elevation projected areas, which we believe will directly relate to how resilient they are to future climate change. Of the countries assessed, Panama contains the most connected climate corridors, largely due to the size and scale of the Darien Protected area. Costa Rica follows Panama, largely due to the importance of La Amistad protected area, a park where the climate corridors for 25 different lowland protected areas. Whilst other countries showed some potential for climate corridors, the quality of putative climate corridors in El Salvador were very low, largely due to the high degree of human modification in this region.  

We developed a prioritization scheme to select potential climate corridors for active restoration initiatives through considering starting protected area size, end protected area size, climate corridor length, quality and protected status. Resulting in the selection of 25 candidate corridors in ~10 distinct geographic locations.

Finally, we developed cutting edge tools, grounded in circuit theory, to visual potential climate connectivity in central america in high resolution and apply this to 10 different regions. Finally,  we advocate for the development of a novel 'Climate Resilience Index' to reflect each protected areas isolation from high elevation refugia. This index could be broadly applied within this study region and beyond. 

Ultimately, this work demonstrates that we cannot take for granted that the ranges of terrestrial mammals will be able to shift in responce to climate change. The majorty of our lowland protected areas are fairly remote from high elevation refugia, and considerable restoration work is required to address this issue. 

## Approach
The approach we have taken in this report revolves around three key elements:

- to produce a fully interactive dosument where users can see and explore the underlying data
- to use state of the art remote sensing layers and methodologies to explore connectivity (e.g. Google Earth Engine)
- to provide actionable information for the design of corridors and directions of restoration activities

It is important to note that all the assessments of connectivity here rely on habitat structural variables, rather than the movement or habitat selection of individual species, and should be interpreted as such. The surfaces will be most relevant to terrestrial, primary forest dwelling mammals.

All of the data to reproduce the analysis and code in this report is stored, [in this location](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16WO_xH6B66D0dqyfeISHEB0mfU9cWWZg?usp=sharing). Email [Chris Beirne](c.w.beirne@gmail.com) for access. 

All of the underlying code and data will ultimately be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisBeirne/Connectivity_Project). 

## Report structure

The structure of the report follows the statement of work outlined in the research agreement:

1) Assemble of data sets at the appropriate scale and resolution to be included in the connectivity analysis (see the [data assembly chapter](#data-assembly).

2) Integrate remote sensed layers of habitat state and land-use into different cost surfaces (capturing barriers to wildlife movement) across the focal landscapes (see the [resistance surface chapter](#cost-surface). 

3) Run simulations exploring the degree of connectivity between specified low and high elevation protected areas (‘nodes’), using the different cost-surface scenarios (see the [least cost paths](#lcp) and [circuitscape](#circuitscape) chapters). 

4) Use the output of the models to identify key locations where land-use change or habitat restoration could enhance low-high elevation connectivity and overlaps with existing corridors / important areas (see [the synthesis chapter](#synthesis)). 

Finally, high resolution land use maps should be produced for conservation and restoration planning. This should be underpinned by the analysis outlined in this document.

# NOPTES FOR THE INTRO

## Justification:


For the connectivity evaluation, our aim was to identify broad regions of habitat that have the
potential to facilitate the movement of multiple species and maintain ecological processes.


Land-use and land-cover changes have impacted the ability of many natural ecosystems to provide ecosystem goods and services for an ever-growing human population. This often has unintended consequences that may threaten biodiversity and ecosystem health.





 In the context of multi-functional land-use planning, there is growing interest in species-agnostic approaches, modelling connectivity as a function of human landscape modification. 



**Elevational gradients**

From: Elsen PR, Monahan WB, Merenlender AM (2018) Global patterns of protection of elevational gradients in mountain ranges. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 115:6004–6009. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1720141115
      This paper assess the within park elevational covergae. This goes a step further through analysisng the between park structural connectivity between reefs and ridges. They state: ". Ensuring conserva-tion outcomes for PAs with lower IUCN designations as well asstrategically placing PAs to better represent and connect elevationalgradients will enhance ecological representation and facilitate spe-cies range shifts under climate change." "  Enhancing pro-tection along elevational gradients may be particularly important, in mitigating biodiversity loss as climate change is projected tosimultaneously alter elevational distributions of agriculture (16),human populations (17), and natural resources (18). Despite ageneral understanding of the importance of protecting elevationalgradients for the maintenance of ecological and evolutionaryprocesses, we lack knowledge of where and how well elevationalgradients are protected at broad geographic scales." WOW!



Key assumptions:

We presume throughout that:

 The organism in question is on average minimizing its costs when moving through this matrix - an assumption possibly appropriate for terrestrial animals, and terrestrial animal-dispersed plants. Other animals will require different approaches.

structural connectivity focuses only on landscape characteristics (e.g., movement corridors, barriers),


NOTE - from corridorsdesign - "Our methods, together with the CorridorDesigner ArcGIS tools, are best suited for designing corridors in a heterogenous landscape at a regional (e.g. 2 - 500 km long) scale."

The best way to conduct this may be through using the graph apporach to identify key least cost paths -> then exploding those with circuitscape into finer detail.

## Types of Connectivity - structural is important in this context

From "Marrec R, Abdel Moniem HE, Iravani M, et al (2020) Conceptual framework and uncertainty analysis for large-scale, species-agnostic modelling of landscape connectivity across Alberta, Canada. Sci Rep 10:1–14. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63545-z"

"Natural ecosystems offer habitat for many species, and human landscape modification typically involves habitat loss as well as the breaking up of continuous habitats into smaller remnant patches (fragmentation)9,10. Consequently, landscapes may lose connectivity, i.e., the degree to which they facilitate movement of organisms and their genes among patches11,12. Landscape connectivity can be quantified in three ways: structural landscape connectivity, potential functional connectivity, and actual functional connectivity13. Structural landscape connectivity can be determined from physical attributes, based on maps alone without reference to organismal movement behaviour. Potential functional connectivity relies on a set of assumptions on organismal movement behaviour to implement an organism perspective, e.g. by mapping a species’ habitat and setting a dispersal threshold. In contrast, actual functional connectivity refers to observed data (e.g., patch occupancy, radio tracking, mark-recapture, or molecular genetic data) that reflect actual rates of the exchange of individuals (or their genes) and may be used to test models of structural or potential functional connectivity"

"We argue that a species-agnostic approach is conceptually better suited for integrating landscape connectivity into land-use planning, whereas a focal-species approach is better suited for conservation management (Fig. 1). Understanding the difference between these perspectives can help clarify conceptual differences, guide researchers in making decisions about how to model connectivity, and inform practitioners about the potential and limitations of resulting maps. Conservation is often based on focal species, e.g., in species-at-risk management, where it is paramount to adopt an organism perspective60 to define critical habitat and to consider the organism’s ability to move between habitat patches. This will result in a model of potential functional connectivity for the specific organism of interest, and a multi-species model can be derived by overlaying models for a representative suite of species10,22. In contrast, land-use planning focuses on the sustainable development of multi-functional landscapes. In this human-centred perspective, land parcel ownership and administrative boundaries define the relevant spatial scale and the degree to which landscape development can be influenced by policy, which in the case of Alberta includes the introduction of ecosystem services and biodiversity markets that play a major role in balancing environmental considerations with socio-economic drivers59. Regarding landscape connectivity, the focus thus lies on how human landscape alteration affects the connectivity of the remaining natural heritage system and how to compare the expected effect of local development alternatives on larger-scale connectivity. This focus is highly compatible with the modelling of connectivity based on human modification, which will result in a model of structural landscape connectivity."
